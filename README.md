## Creating a Branch in GitHub

To create a branch in GitHub, please follow these steps:

1. Go to the TeamWIPMLDS GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Branch: main" button on the left side of the page.
3. In the "Find or create a branch" field, type in a name for your branch (e.g. "feature-branch").
4. Click on the "Create branch" button.
5. You should now be on your newly created branch. Make sure to switch to this branch before making any changes.

By creating a separate branch for each feature or change, we can work on our changes independently without affecting the work of others. It also helps us keep track of the changes we make and makes it easier to review and merge changes.

## Making a Pull Request in GitHub

Once you've made changes to your branch and are ready to merge them into the main branch, you can create a pull request by following these steps:

1. Go to the TeamWIPMLDS GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Pull requests" tab.
3. Click on the green "New pull request" button.
4. Select your branch from the "Compare" dropdown menu.
5. Review the changes that you've made in the pull request.
6. Add a title and description to the pull request to describe the changes you've made. Also mention me "@ajhela" in the descritpion so I am notified.
7. Click on the "Create pull request" button.

The configuration manager will review your pull request and make sure that it doesn't have any problems. Once the pull request is approved, the changes will be merged into the main branch and the branch being merged will be deleted.
